BottomSheet ->
val bottomSheetState = rememberModalBottomSheetState(initialValue = ModalBottomSheetValue.Hidden)
Explanation
rememberModalBottomSheetState: This function is a key part of Jetpack Compose's Material library. It creates and remembers a state object that controls the behavior of a ModalBottomSheet. Think of it like a remote control for your bottom sheet.
bottomSheetState: This is the variable where you store the state object created by rememberModalBottomSheetState. You'll use this variable to interact with and control the bottom sheet (showing, hiding, etc.).
initialValue = ModalBottomSheetValue.Hidden: This sets the initial state of the bottom sheet to Hidden. This means when your composable first appears, the bottom sheet will not be visible.
Purpose
The primary purpose of using rememberModalBottomSheetState is to gain fine-grained control over a ModalBottomSheet within your Jetpack Compose UI. Here's what it enables you to do:
Show and Hide: You can programmatically show and hide the bottom sheet using functions like show() and hide() on the bottomSheetState object.
Animation Control: You can customize the animation of the bottom sheet as it appears and disappears.
State Tracking: You can track the current state of the bottom sheet (hidden, expanded, half-expanded) and react to changes in its state.

Select Room logic in RestUiState ->
Explanation
DataSource.loadHotels():

This function call is assumed to return a list of hotels. Each hotel object presumably contains information about its rooms.
flatMap { hotel -> hotel.rooms.map { it.roomName to "Select" } }:

This part is a combination of flatMap and map functions from the Kotlin standard library.
flatMap transforms each element of the list into an iterable (in this case, a list of pairs) and then flattens the resulting lists into a single list.
For each hotel, hotel.rooms.map { it.roomName to "Select" } creates a list of pairs where each pair consists of a room name and the string "Select".
.toMap():

This function converts the list of pairs into a map. Each pair becomes an entry in the map, with the room name as the key and "Select" as the value.
Step-by-Step Breakdown
Loading Hotels:

DataSource.loadHotels() retrieves a list of hotel objects. Assume the structure of a hotel object is something like this:
kotlin
Copy code
data class Hotel(val name: String, val rooms: List<Room>)
data class Room(val roomName: String, val roomImage: Int, val price: Double)
Example:
kotlin
Copy code
val hotels = listOf(
    Hotel("Hotel A", listOf(Room("Room A1", 1, 100.0), Room("Room A2", 2, 150.0))),
    Hotel("Hotel B", listOf(Room("Room B1", 3, 200.0)))
)
Mapping and Flattening:

flatMap is used to iterate over each hotel.
For each hotel, hotel.rooms.map { it.roomName to "Select" } creates a list of pairs where each room name is paired with the string "Select".
Example for Hotel A:
kotlin
Copy code
listOf("Room A1" to "Select", "Room A2" to "Select")
Flattening:

The lists of pairs from all hotels are flattened into a single list:
kotlin
Copy code
listOf("Room A1" to "Select", "Room A2" to "Select", "Room B1" to "Select")
Converting to Map:

The toMap function converts the list of pairs into a map:
kotlin
Copy code
mapOf("Room A1" to "Select", "Room A2" to "Select", "Room B1" to "Select")
Final Code
kotlin
Copy code
val roomStatuses: Map<String, String> = DataSource.loadHotels()
    .flatMap { hotel -> hotel.rooms.map { it.roomName to "Select" } }
    .toMap()
Summary
DataSource.loadHotels(): Fetches a list of hotels.
flatMap { hotel -> hotel.rooms.map { it.roomName to "Select" } }: Transforms each hotel into a list of room name and "Select" pairs and flattens them into a single list.
toMap(): Converts the list of pairs into a map where each room name is a key, and the value is the string "Select".

backStackEntry?.destination? . route? : Screens. hotelListScreen. name
explain this syntax ?
what is backstack ?
backStack is concept that is used by android to store the history of the screen user has visited, So
in default screen it should not show back button like in our case hotelListScreen.kt is default screen,
Each screen is stored in backstack is called as entry, every time user clicks back button as entry gets
cleared from backstack, no screens available in back stack no back should get appear.
(Lets implement it now, goto file StartScreen.kt, to implement this first we need reference to BS)

1. backStackEntry?
backStackEntry: This is likely a variable holding a reference to a NavBackStackEntry object, which represents a screen in your navigation stack.
? (Safe Call Operator): This operator is crucial for handling potential null values. It means "If backStackEntry is not null, proceed; otherwise, stop here and the whole expression evaluates to null." This prevents null pointer exceptions.
2. .destination?
.destination: Assuming backStackEntry is not null, this accesses the destination property of the NavBackStackEntry. The destination property holds information about the screen itself (its route, arguments, etc.).
? (Safe Call Operator): Again, we use the safe call operator because the destination property could potentially be null in some scenarios.
3. .route
.route: If both backStackEntry and its destination are not null, this extracts the route property, which is a string uniquely identifying the screen within your navigation graph.
4. ?: Screens.hotelListScreen.name
?: (Elvis Operator): This operator provides a fallback value. If the expression to its left (the attempt to get the route) results in null, the expression to its right is used instead.
Screens.hotelListScreen.name: This is your default value. It likely refers to a named route for your "hotel list" screen, defined in your navigation setup.
In Summary
This entire expression tries to get the route of the screen represented by backStackEntry. If, for any reason, backStackEntry is null, or its destination is null, or the route itself is null, the expression gracefully falls back to the route of your "hotel list" screen.
Common Use Cases
This pattern is often used in Jetpack Compose Navigation for scenarios like:
Up Navigation: Determining the route of the previous screen to navigate back.
Default Navigation: Providing a fallback route if the current screen is the initial one in the navigation flow.
Let me know if you have any more questions or want to explore specific examples of how this syntax is used in practice!

Explanation:
val canNavigateBack = navController.previousBackStackEntry != null ?
navController: This is your NavController object, which manages navigation between different composables (screens) in your Jetpack Compose application.
.previousBackStackEntry: This property of the NavController gives you access to the NavBackStackEntry representing the screen that was active before the current one. It essentially peeks into the navigation history.
!= null: This part checks if the previousBackStackEntry is not null. In other words, it checks if there actually is a previous screen to navigate back to.
canNavigateBack: This variable stores the result of the check (either true or false). It indicates whether or not you can navigate back in the navigation stack.
